# 01204223 OS Report Problem B: Memory Layout
This repo contains C code demonstrating how the stack, heap and data grow.

## Instructions
1. **(Requires GNU Make)** Run ```make``` in your terminal of choice. If successful, a new executable file named ```main.exe``` (Windows) or ```main``` (Linux/MacOS) should be present in the working directory. The program is executed by default when ```make``` is executed.
2. **(Manual compilation)** Run ```gcc main.c -o main``` to compile the C code, followed by ```main.exe``` (Windows) or ```./main``` (Linux/MacOS) to run.
